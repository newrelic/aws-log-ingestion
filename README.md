# New Relic CloudWatch Logs ingestion

AWS Serverless application that sends log data from CloudWatch Logs to New Relic.

## Requirements

To forward data to New Relic you need a [New Relic License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key).

## Install and configure

To install and configure the New Relic Cloudwatch Logs Lambda, [see our documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-logs/enable-logs/aws-cloudwatch-plugin-logs).

Additional notes:
* Some users in UTF-8 environments have reported difficulty with defining strings of `NR_TAGS` delimited by the semicolon `;` character. If this applies to you, you can set an alternative delimiter character as the value of `NR_ENV_DELIMITER`, and separate your `NR_TAGS` with that. 

## Manual Deployment

If your organization restricts access to deploy via SAR, follow these steps below
to deploy the log ingestion function manually.

### SAM

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion.git`
2. [Install the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) Make sure you have >=0.33.0 installed, you can check with `sam --version`.
3. [Retrieve your New Relic License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key)
4. Build the SAM application (if on Linux `-u` can be omitted): `sam build -u --parameter-overrides 'ParameterKey=NRLicenseKey,ParameterValue=your-license-key-here'`
5. Deploy the SAM application: `sam deploy --guided`

Additional notes:

* To set `LOGGING_ENABLED`: `sam build ... --parameter-overrides 'ParameterKey=NRLoggingEnabled,ParameterValue=True'`

### Serverless

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion.git`
2. Install Serverless: `npm install -g serverless`
3. Install the serverless-python-requirements plugin: `sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements`
4. If not running Linux, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
5. [Retrieve your New Relic License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key)
6. Set the LICENSE_KEY environment variable: `export LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key-here`
7. Deploy the function: `sls deploy`

Additional notes:

* To set `LOGGING_ENABLED`: `export LOGGING_ENABLED=True` (prior to deploy)

### Terraform

In your Terraform, you can add this as a module, replacing `{{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}}` with your New Relic License Key.

```terraform
module "newrelic_log_ingestion" {
  source             = "github.com/newrelic/aws-log-ingestion"
  nr_license_key     = "{{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}}"
}
```

By default, this will build and pack the lambda zip inside of the Terraform Module. You can supply your own by switching `build_lambda = false`, and specify the path to your lambda, using `lambda_archive = "{{LAMBDA_PATH}}"`, replacing `{{LAMBDA_PATH}}` with the path to your lambda.
